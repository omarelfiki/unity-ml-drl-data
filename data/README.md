# Understanding Results

### Research Question
Can we predict the time-to-threshold, denoting number of training steps and wall-clock time required for
an agent to reach a performance threshold using initial configuration and early learning-curve signals?

#### Targets (to predict)
* Wall clock time (s) (observed seconds).
* Time-to-threshold (derived) from per-step reward logs: steps/time to reach a target reward.
